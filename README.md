# ResiGateNet
In our project, we aim to tackle the pressing issue of detecting depression and suicidal ideation through social media content. We will be performing classification on the “Suicide and Depression Detection” dataset from Kaggle, which comprises Reddit posts labeled for potential suicidal thoughts. We want to build upon the paper “MGL-CNN: A Hierarchical Posts Representations Model for Identifying Depressed Individuals in Online Forums” by integrating depth-enhancing capabilities of Residual Networks (ResNet) with the Multi-Gated LeakyReLU CNN. The gating mechanism allows the model to focus on the most relevant features, and the residual connections capture the long-range dependencies in textual contexts. The goal is to build an innovative model, “ResiGateNet”, that has the capacity to understand the nuanced language indicative of depression and suicidal ideation, providing a critical tool for the early detection of mental health issues and timely intervention.
